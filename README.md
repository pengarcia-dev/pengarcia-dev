## Presentation
Hello, my name is Pablo. I'm from Cordoba, Spain and I create those repositories because I want to learn Git and GitHub. As I am electronic engineer and I focus on Firmware programmation, I think this repository will be important, because I understand how version control runs and I have a control about my projects.

Thank you for read me and have a nice day!!!!
