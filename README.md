## Presentation
Hello, my name is Pablo. I'm from Cordoba, Spain and I create these repositories because I want to learn Git and GitHub. As I am electronic engineer and I focus on Firmware programming, I believe this repository will be useful for me. It helps me understand how version control works and allows me to better manage my projects.

Thank you for reading, and have a great day!
